Chapter 4: Training Models
----------------------------

Work on this after introducing Chapter 8.

Mid-March.

Spring Break is on March 23-31.

Tuesday

Regression with the mushroom data.
Wednesday -- iriskm assignment due at 5:00

Tuesday

Logistic Regression
Gradient Descent
Thursday

Finish up Gradient Descent

Run our linear regression algorithm on the mushroom data -- We'll need to tweak our class just a bit to adjust sizes based on the data we give it.
Tweak our learning to adjust the learning rate as we iterate
Convert our algorithm to learn using the logistic function and be amazed
Make a version that can use the logistic regression algorithm to classify multiple classes

Tuesday --

Shared Spreadsheet for Midterm Datasets

Team work on contest

Midterm Analysis Requirements

Select a dataset that requires classification -- I'll set up a shared google spreadsheet for you to publish your selected dataset. I'd like to keep duplication to a minimum.
Prepare a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates you have done exploratory data analysis on your selected data set. Make sure you document at the top of the notebook what you are classifying.
Clean and prepare your dataset, documenting any additional variables you have computed, rescaling, removal of variables, etc.
Compare the results of the classification task using 3 different methods that we have discussed in class. You should have a summary section where you do the comparison of - accuracy, confusion matrix, report, ROC curve and area under the ROC. Make sure to explain any big differences between your different methods.
Due: By Thursday April 12. We will use class time on the 12th and 17th for each of you to make a presentation of your work.

Thursday - short team presentations on contest

By Tuesday April 10 Can you reproduce your results on the full data set??
